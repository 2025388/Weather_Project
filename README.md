# Weather_Project
Documentation of the stages of gathering data from Eras Databese
In the files attached to this Repository, all the codes created in order to understand the functionalities of the ERAs 5 from Copernicus weather databases can be found
This is a personal project which i used in order to gain undestanding of some processes of EDA methodology and Python coding in order to get prepared for my master degree.
This poject began in late february 2025. It is not going to be able to be completed due to the lack of infraestructure to store all the data and be able to create a proper weather model! 
this files are uploaded to proof the ownership of the code in the CA by Diego Molina and as reference of the learning process i had before summer 2025
